# CNAM & Spam Tag Detection using Android + OCR

This project aims to detect **improper spam labeling and CNAM (Caller Name)** issues that cannot be addressed solely by STIR/SHAKEN compliance.

---

## üìå Background

According to [Numeracle's Insight](https://www.numeracle.com/insights/stir-shaken-doesnt-stop-improper-spam-labeling), **STIR/SHAKEN** helps validate caller ID authenticity but does **not** stop legitimate calls from being mislabeled as **spam**.

Even fully authenticated calls can be tagged due to **reputation-based analytics** (volume, patterns, reports).

---

## ‚ùå Problem

- STIR/SHAKEN attestation does **not influence** spam labeling significantly.
- Carriers apply **independent call labeling** rules.
- No SIP-level method to extract ‚ÄúSpam Likely‚Äù / ‚ÄúScam Risk‚Äù tags.
- 
## Problem Summary

- CNAM and spam labels like ‚ÄúSpam Likely‚Äù, ‚ÄúScam Risk‚Äù, or ‚ÄúVerified Caller‚Äù are determined by the receiving carrier.
- These labels are not transmitted in SIP or RTP packets ‚Äî they are delivered to the end device over proprietary signaling protocols, and only appear on the screen of the phone receiving the call.
- As someone with over 10 years of hands-on experience with Asterisk, I can state with full confidence: this information is never present in SIP INVITE, headers, or any part of the SIP protocol.
- Therefore, it is technically impossible to detect CNAM or spam tagging using Asterisk or any SIP-based system or proxy (e.g., Kamailio, OpenSIPS, FreeSWITCH).

## ‚úÖ Solution

We propose a **hardware-based real-world monitoring** approach:

### üß© Architecture Overview

```
VoIP System (Asterisk/STIR)
        |
        v
 Android Device + SIM  --->  Screenshot Capture App
        |                          |
        v                          v
   Incoming Calls        --->    Screenshot (.png)
                                     |
                                     v
                           Centralized OCR Server
                                     |
                                     v
                              CNAM / SPAM Logs (JSON)
```

## üõ† Deliverables

1. **Android App**
   - Captures screenshot on incoming call.
   - Sends image to backend server.

2. **Backend (Dockerized)**
   - OCR service (Tesseract / Vision API).
   - Logging, spam tag parsing, JSON export.

3. **Dashboard UI**
   - View devices, logs, CNAM, ‚ÄúSpam Likely‚Äù counts.
   - Export CSV or JSON.

4. **Deployment Docs**
   - Android setup
   - Docker instructions
   - Integration guide
